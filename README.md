## About
This is a fun gimmick for our internal secret santa at Netlife in 2022. The repository is based on [Clumsy Bird](https://github.com/ellisonleao/clumsy-bird) by [Ellisonleao](https://github.com/ellisonleao) and most of the work is done by other people than myself, who I owe my gratitude to for allowing me to do this in very short time.

## Credits
- [Clumsy Bird](https://github.com/ellisonleao/clumsy-bird) by Ellisonleao.
- The song is FeSTV FRLiX by [Shane Ivers](https://www.silvermansound.com).
